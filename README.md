This R script works with a dataset to explore and model factors related to health conditions, specifically focusing on hypertension and diabetes. It begins by reading and cleaning the data, performing various transformations (like renaming and recoding variables), and joining multiple datasets to create a unified one. Then, it handles missing data, filters out individuals with incomplete records, and reshapes the data for analysis. The script includes descriptive statistics, cross-tabulations, and visualizations like box plots and bar charts to explore relationships between variables such as education, age, marital status, and health conditions. The script also performs logistic regression modeling to predict hypertension status based on the other variables, assesses model accuracy, and calculates the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for model evaluation using ROC curves.
